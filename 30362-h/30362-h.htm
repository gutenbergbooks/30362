<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>This volume contains a large selection from Paul Gerhardt's
&ldquo;Spiritual Songs.&rdquo; Every piece included is
given in full, and is rendered into the metre of the
original. A few of the following translations have
appeared at various times during the last three years in
different periodicals. They have been revised for this
volume. Several of the hymns have been beautifully
translated by others; and had the Translator been compiling
a volume composed of selections from various
authors, this might have formed a strong reason for
not doing them again, but to have omitted them from
a volume like the present would have been to give a
selection from Gerhardt without some of his most celebrated
productions; besides, in the other collections
where they appear they are not all given in full, nor
are they always rendered into the metre of the original,
<span class="pb" id="pg_viii">[viii]</span>
save in those published with the music attached. As
far as the Translator is aware, the greater number of
the following songs have never appeared in an English
dress before.</p>
<p>Every one who has reflected on the subject, or attempted
metrical translation, knows that literality is
rarely attainable, that a certain measure of freedom
must be used. The Translator has, however, striven
to maintain fidelity to the sense of the original, and
has occasionally somewhat sacrificed euphony to fidelity.</p>
<p>It is not to be expected that the people's poet of one
nation and of a former age will become, through translation,
the people's poet of another nation in a later
generation. Individual translations may win for themselves
a place side by side with the favourite songs of
native growth. Instances of this will occur to every
one familiar with our hymnology; but this can hardly
happen in many cases. The translations on the principle
of this volume may neither be uninteresting nor
unedifying on that account, and it may be permitted
to the Translator to trust that Paul Gerhardt in his
present dress may be found stimulating and refreshing
<span class="pb" id="pg_ix">[ix]</span>
to many. Gerhardt was peculiarly a son of consolation.
The Translator has found him so in the hour of trial,
and he will feel repaid if he should become the cup-bearer
of the rich wine of consolation contained in the
hymns of the staunch old German Lutheran to any
English Christian readers &ldquo;who may be in any wise
afflicted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work of translation has been a labour of love.
It has been the recreation of leisure hours from graver
duties, and occasionally the occupation of days of unwilling,
but unavoidable, total or partial freedom from
professional engagements.</p>
<p>The edition used in this translation was Wackernagel's

<h2>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.</h2>
<p>Paul Gerhardt was born in Graefenhainichen in
Electoral Saxony, where his father, Christian Gerhardt,
was Burgomaster. There is some doubt as to the
precise year of his birth, owing to the destruction of
the church books when the place was burnt by the
Swedes on the 16th of April, 1637. According to some,
the event took place in the year 1606; according to
others, in 1607. The probability is in favour of the
former date, for General Superintendent Goltlob Stolze,
of L&uuml;bben,<sup><a id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></sup>
says that he died, in the 70th year of his age, in the year 1676.</p>
<p>There is no information concerning his youth and
education. He was still very young when the
Thirty Years' War broke out, and his preparation
for his profession and entrance on it took place in
those troublous times, which may account for his
late settlement in a ministerial sphere. In the year
1651, when in his forty-fifth year, we find him still only a
<span class="pb" id="pg_xii">[xii]</span>
candidate<sup><a id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></sup>
of theology, and resident as a tutor
in the family of Andreas Bertholdt, Chancery Advocate
in Berlin, whose daughter he subsequently married.
In that year a vacancy occurred in the ministry at
Mittenwald, by the death of Probst Caspar G&ouml;de. The
magistracy of that place applied to the clergy of Berlin
to recommend a suitable man to them for the office.
Paul Gerhardt was their unanimous choice. They
recommended him as an honourable, estimable, and
learned man, whose diligence and erudition were known,
of good parts and incorrupt doctrine, of a peace-loving
disposition and blameless Christian life, which qualities
had procured for him the love of all classes, high and
low, in Berlin. They furthermore added that he had
frequently, at their friendly invitation, exercised the
excellent gifts with which God had endowed him for
the edification of the church, and had thereby deserved
well of the people, and endeared himself to them. The
clergy met together for consultation, and sent this
recommendation to Mittenwald without the knowledge
of Gerhardt; no higher testimony, therefore, could have
been given to his character, learning, and abilities.
<span class="pb" id="pg_xiii">[xiii]</span>
He was accordingly appointed and set apart to his
office in St. Nicholas' Church, Berlin, on the 18th of
November, 1651, and entered before the close of the
year on his duties. The church book which he kept
from Jan. 1, 1652, till Dec. 31, 1656, bears testimony
to his fidelity and conscientiousness in the discharge of
this part of the duties of his office.</p>
<p>On February 11th, 1655, he was married to Anna
Maria, daughter of the Chancery Advocate Bertholdt,
in whose family he had been tutor. Before he left
Mittenwald, his first child, a daughter, was born and
died. There is a slab to her memory still standing in
the church. Several circumstances in his position at
Mittenwald conspired to make Gerhardt desire a change,
and welcome a translation to Berlin when an opportunity
offered. The relation between his colleague,
Deacon Allborn, and himself was not friendly: Allborn
had been passed over by the magistrates in favour of
Gerhardt. The want of cordiality which prevailed in
consequence must have been very trying to a man of
Gerhardt's disposition. The income of the office was
also small, and his circumstances consequently straitened.
His ties and associations in Berlin would also
be strong inducements of themselves to the acceptance
of an appointment there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_xiv">[xiv]</div>
<p>The welcome relief came when the magistrates appointed
him to the third Diaconate of St. Nicholas'
Church, vacant by the death of Probst Peter Vher, and
the consequent promotion of the other ministers. The
spirit in which he received and accepted the invitation
is shown in his letter to the magistrates on accepting
their offer. He humbly and gratefully recognized the
hand of God in the matter; and, owning his own weakness,
earnestly solicited the prayers of the faithful.
His letter is dated June 4, 1657, and in the register of
St. Nicholas there is an entry of a baptism made by
him on the 22nd of July. Consequently he must
have entered on his duties soon after. Gerhardt, doubtless,
joyfully returned to Berlin, anticipating a happy
ministry there; but it was there his greatest trials
awaited him. These trials arose out of the measures taken by Frederick
William,<sup><a id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></sup>
at that time Elector of Brandenburg, to allay the animosity prevailing
between the adherents of the Lutheran and Reformed Confessions
respectively. The feud was of long standing, and
the efforts made to heal it had been hitherto in vain.</p>
<p>With the laudable desire of pacifying party strife,
<span class="pb" id="pg_xv">[xv]</span>
the Elector appointed a conference to be held between
the Lutheran and Reformed clergy of Berlin and C&ouml;ln-on-the-Spree,
under the direction of the Lord President,
Baron Otto von Schwerin, on the Reformed side, and
Chancellor Lorenz Christian von Somnitz, of Pomerania,
and others, on the Lutheran side. The Lutheran clergy
of the three chief churches in Berlin and C&ouml;ln, and the
Reformed court preachers, Bartholomew Stosch and
Johann Kunschius, the rector of the Joachimsthal
Gymnasium, and the philologue Joh. Vorstius, constituted
the membership of the conference. Kunschius,
being soon after summoned to accompany the Elector
to K&ouml;nigsberg, took no part in the conferences, and
his place was filled by Gerson Vechner, of the Joachimsthal
Gymnasium.</p>
<p>The object of the Conference, according to the Electoral
Rescript, was to consider the following points:&mdash;</p>
<p>I. Whether in the Reformed Confessions, particularly
in those named in the last Electoral Edict
(January 2nd, 1662), viz.:&mdash;The Confessio Sigismundi, the
Colloquium Lipsiacum, the Declaratio Thoruniensis,&mdash;anything
is taught or affirmed, in teaching, believing,
or affirming which any one is, <i>judicio divino</i>,
accursed.</p>
<p>II. Whether anything is denied or passed over in
<span class="pb" id="pg_xvi">[xvi]</span>
silence, without acknowledging or practising which no
one could be saved.</p>
<p>The Berlin clergy were reluctant to enter on the
conference. They thought that as it concerned the
Church of the Mark generally it should not be limited
to Berlin and C&ouml;ln, and that it was a subject requiring
mature consideration. At length, however, having protested
in vain, they consented, but manifestly determined
to concede nothing.</p>
<p>The conference met at various times during the
years 1662-63. Gerhardt took no public part. The
speaking devolved first on Probst Lilius, but soon
afterwards, and for the remainder of the meetings, on
Archdeacon Reinhardt. Gerhardt wrote a judgment
unfavourable to the conferences, because he thought
nothing but syncretism would come out of it&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the
confusion of the two confessions, into which the Rinteln
theologians had permitted themselves to be seduced. By his votes he
evinced his interest in all its proceedings.<sup><a id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>As might be surmised, from the state of party
feeling, the conference was not only fruitless, but left
<span class="pb" id="pg_xvii">[xvii]</span>
matters in a worse condition than they were when it
first met. Furthermore, at the last sitting but one, on
the 22nd of May, 1663, the Berlin clergy incurred the
high displeasure of the Elector, by defending and
approving the conduct of their speaker Reinhardt on
an occasion when he had given great offence to his
Highness. It is thought, that at this time Gerhardt
wrote his heart-stirring and beautiful hymn,&mdash;Ist Gott
f&uuml;r mich, so trete?
(<a href="#h43">Is God for me, t'oppose me?</a>) The
Elector, in consequence of the result of the conferences,
issued an edict on the 16th of September, 1664,
in substance the same but more stringent than the
previous one. All were required to pledge themselves
to obedience to this edict, whereas subscription to the
former one had been required only from candidates at
ordination. The edict required the clergy of both
confessions, on pain of dismissal from office and other
penalties, to refrain from vituperating each other, from
deducing absurd and impious doctrines from each other's
dogmas, and imputing them to their opponents. The
edict also commanded that the ordinance of baptism
should be administered without exorcism, when the
parents desired it. The edict produced the most profound
consternation. It was regarded as endangering
religious liberty and the freedom of conscience. The
<span class="pb" id="pg_xviii">[xviii]</span>
Lutheran preachers felt themselves hampered by it in
the discharge of their duties. Regarding, as they did,
their symbolical books and ecclesiastical customs as
sacred things, using their authorized formularies in the
instruction of the people, and introducing the element
of controversy largely into their ministrations, they felt
themselves quite crippled in the discharge of their functions.
It seemed to them that if they gave up their
liberty in the pulpit, they would be necessitated to
give up their customs also, and so violate their solemn
obligations. They thought that compliance would imperil
the Lutheran Church, the welfare of their congregations,
and the peace of their own souls. Such was
the view taken of the matter by many strict and conscientious
men. We cannot help thinking that their
view was mistaken and exaggerated, that these things
were not endangered, that it was perfectly possible for
them to have been loyal to their church, to have instructed
their people faithfully in all the peculiar doctrines
of their system, and yet have rendered obedience
to the Electoral edict.</p>
<p>Many were actually conducting themselves both
according to its letter and spirit, and yet were filled
with those alarms which we must call groundless, at
the very thought of binding themselves by a pledge to
<span class="pb" id="pg_xix">[xix]</span>
act as they were doing. While we hold them to have
been mistaken, we cannot but respect their fidelity to
their honest convictions, and their fortitude in accepting
the sad consequences,&mdash;the severing of the ties that
bound them to beloved flocks, the loss of office and
emolument, and expatriation. The principles of toleration
were not rightly understood, either by the Church
or State at the time.</p>
<p>As we read the painful annals of the time, the thought
often arises in the mind, how much better had it been
if the evil which it was the laudable intention of the
Elector to correct, had been permitted to work its own
cure. There were doubtless many, who had given too
much cause for complaint by the licence they allowed
themselves in the pulpit in attacking their theological
adversaries, but those who suffered most would probably
be those, who, like Gerhardt, were not open to
reproach, yet felt themselves constrained by conscience
to refuse obedience to the Elector's command. Hundreds
signed the edict. Some who had scruples yielded
on account of their wives and children. There was a
witticism current at the time which was put into the
mouths of the pastors' wives:&mdash;</p>

<p>Which may be freely and roughly rendered,&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Subscribe, subscribe, dear husband, do!</p>
<p class="t0">Lest you must from the parish go.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Very many, however, were thrown into the greatest
distress of mind, and could not obey and preserve a
good conscience. The Berlin ministers sought the
opinion of various theological faculties and churches on
the crisis.</p>
<p>The Elector, ignorant of the trouble given to the
consciences of many worthy men, viewed this conduct
on their part as self-willed, and an unwarrantable opposition
to what appeared to him a needful regulation.
He ordered Lilius and Reinhardt to be removed from
office, if they delayed to subscribe, and gave the others
time for consideration. The two former, failing to obey,
were deposed.</p>
<p>Gerhardt, with the three others who were threatened,
turned to the magistracy, and solicited their good offices
in intercession with the Elector. The magistrates
represented to the Elector that the Berlin clergy had
observed the edict, but that they objected to subscription;
they begged the Elector not to enforce subscription
on those already in office, as it would tend to compromise
them with the people and foreign churches; they furthermore
stated, that obedience rests not so much in
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxi">[xxi]</span>
subscription and in the letter, as in the mind and in
deed. They begged him to reinstate Lilius and Reinhardt
in office.</p>
<p>The Berlin clergy presented a petition, substantially
to the same effect, at the same time. They stated, in
addition, that the Reformed clergy had not been compelled
to sign. The only result of this petition was,
that the Reformed were forthwith commanded to subscribe the edict.</p>
<p>The ministers, in another document, set forth their
scruples at large, but thereby only incurred the further
displeasure of the Elector. The deposition of Lilius
and Reinhardt, however, caused such an uproar, that
the Elector issued a declaration on May 4, 1665,
setting forth the seasons of his procedure. Further
efforts were made, and the result was, that time was
allowed to Lilius to reconsider his refusal, and in the
beginning of the following year he subscribed. On
account of his compliance, he became the object of the
most bitter and galling attacks, and did not long survive.
The last days of the old man were embittered by the
treatment he received at the hands of zealous, but uncharitable
Lutherans, and death was doubtless a welcome
event to him. In the case of Reinhardt, the result
was only a more severe sentence. He was banished
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxii">[xxii]</span>
from the town, forbidden to maintain any correspondence
with it, and the magistrates were ordered to fill
up the vacancy caused by his removal. He removed
to Leipzig, where he was chosen to the pastorate of
St. Nicholas' Church, and was subsequently made Professor
of Theology, which office he held till his death,
in 1669.</p>
<p>Paul Gerhardt was the next minister who was called
on to subscribe the edict. The Elector was convinced
that, next to Reinhardt, he was the most vehement
opponent of peace between the Lutheran and Reformed.
When Reinhardt was reproached in the Consistory with
inciting his colleagues to resistance, Gerhardt said, with
some warmth, that it was not so, that he had encouraged
Reinhardt when he showed a disposition to
yield; he was older in years, and had been longer in
office, and he should be sorry to follow others. It was
also said, that during an illness which befell him, he
sent for his colleagues, and earnestly warned them not
to subscribe the bond pledging them to observance of
the edict. These things were, at least, carried to the
Elector, and prejudiced him against Gerhardt. On the
same day that Lilius was reinstated in office, Gerhardt
was cited to appear before the Consistory (Feb. 6th,
1666), and called upon to sign. Eight days were allowed
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxiii">[xxiii]</span>
him for consideration, and in the first instance he accepted
the delay, but before the rising of the same
session, he declared that he had had ample time for
consideration, and that he could not change his mind,
whereupon he was deposed from office, in the name of
the Elector.</p>
<p>Great as was the agitation produced in the public
mind by the deposition of Lilius and Reinhardt, the sensation
occasioned by Gerhardt's was much more profound.
He was the most beloved, as well as most
celebrated, of all the ministers. Measures were immediately
taken by the community in his favour. The
citizens and the guilds of the cloth-makers, bakers,
butchers, tailors, and pewterers, united to petition the
magistrates in favour of exemption for Gerhardt. They
said that every one knew that he had never spoken
against the faith and the co-religionists of the Elector,
much less vituperated them, but that he had sought
to lead every one to true Christianity, and had never
attacked any one in word or deed.</p>
<p>The magistrates, on presenting this representation to
the Elector, on the 13th of February, added:&mdash;&ldquo;He
has not thought of the Reformed, much less insulted
them; he has maintained a blameless walk, giving
offence to no one, so much so, that his Highness, without
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxiv">[xxiv]</span>
any suspicion, had admitted his songs into the hymn-book
for the Mark, in 1658. Should a man so pious,
so intellectual, so celebrated in many lands, leave the
town, it was to be feared that grave thoughts would
be excited in the minds of foreigners, and that God
would visit them for it. If he refused subscription,
it would not be imputed to disobedience, but to scruples
of conscience, seeing that before the publication of the
edict he had fulfilled its object by his modest behaviour.&rdquo;
The Prince, in reply, stated that he had sufficient
grounds for enforcing the provisions of the edict,
and that Gerhardt must comply with them, or bear
the penalty.</p>
<p>A second petition was got up in his favour, in which,
in addition to the above guilds, the carpenters, cutlers,
armourers, and coppersmiths joined. As this petition
also was unfavourably received, the States of the Mark
took up the cause of the deposed. &ldquo;The dismissal of
Gerhardt,&rdquo; they informed the Elector, on the 27th of
July, 1666, &ldquo;excited great fear in the country for
religion, for this man is recognized by the adherents of
both confessions as a pious, exemplary, and, without
doubt, a peace-loving theologian, against whom no
charge can be brought save his refusal to subscribe the
edicts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_xxv">[xxv]</div>
<p>The Elector yielded at length. After his return
from Cleve, he summoned the magistrates to appear
before him, on January 9th, 1667, at three o'clock in
the afternoon; and through the Lord President, Otto
von Schwerin, in presence of several privy councillors,
made the desired, but hardly expected announcement,
that as there was no complaint against Paul Gerhardt,
save that he refused to subscribe the edicts, his Electoral
Highness must believe that he has misunderstood the
purport of them; he, therefore, restored him to his office,
and absolved him from the necessity of subscription.</p>
<p>Immediately after the audience, the Elector sent a
private secretary to Gerhardt, to convey the intelligence
to him, and to say at the same time that his
Highness cherished the confident expectation that he
would act conformably to the edicts, without subscription,
and continue to manifest his known moderation.
Next day the magistrates, delighted with the grace of
the Prince, hastened to inform Gerhardt of his unconditional
restoration to office, and on the 12th of January,
the joyous event was announced in the <i>Sunday Mercury</i>,
a weekly paper very much read in Berlin at that
time. But the private message from the Elector threw
Gerhardt into fresh distress of mind. He felt hampered
by the condition still attached to his restoration to
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxvi">[xxvi]</span>
office, and he applied to the magistrates to aid him in
discovering the exact terms of his restoration. In his
letter to the magistrates, he expressed his earnest desire
to spend the remainder of his life among his flock,
if he could do so with a good conscience, saying how
wretched a thing it was to hold office with an uneasy
conscience. He knew the anxieties incident to the
faithful discharge of the pastoral office, and said, that
he would be the most wretched man on earth if to
them were added the reproaches of a guilty conscience.
His desire was not in the very least to appear to depart
from his previous mode of teaching, and from the customs
of his church, which, as a Lutheran clergyman,
he had sworn to maintain. Referring to the moderation
which had been so commended in him, he said,
&ldquo;I have never understood it, and never can understand
it otherwise, than that I shall be permitted to
remain faithful to my Lutheran confessions of faith, and
especially to the &lsquo;Formula Concordiae,' and that I am
not required to regard any of them, or permit others to
regard any one of them, as a dishonourable, injurious,
or blasphemous book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magistrates sent him a copy of the decree
reinstating him in office, hoping thereby to remove his
scruples. He made a further representation to the
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxvii">[xxvii]</span>
magistrates on the 26th of January, 1667. In this he
pointed out how the decree ascribed his refusal to a
misunderstanding of the edicts, and that, though absolved
from subscription, he was bound by them still;
that he could only understand the edicts literally; that
he could not re-enter his office with any other conscience
than he had first entered it with; he could not
inflict on himself the wound on re-entrance into office
which he had, in the strength of the Holy Ghost,
patiently and silently endured a year's suspension to
avoid; that if his conscience permitted him to yield
obedience he would subscribe the edicts, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;what I can do with a good conscience, I can easily
consent and promise to do.&rdquo; He begged them to
intercede for him with the Prince, that he might be
absolved from obedience to the edicts on resuming
office. In everything else he promised all possible
hearty and humble obedience. He begged that he
might be permitted to adhere to his Lutheran Confessions
and &ldquo;Formula Concordiae;&rdquo; that he might so
instruct his flock, and pledge himself to no other
moderation than was rooted in these confessions. Only
on these terms, he said, could he consent to preach.
Gerhardt also wrote to the Elector to the same effect.</p>
<p>The magistrates resolved once more to apply to the
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxviii">[xxviii]</span>
Elector. They briefly stated the case, and begged his
Highness to relieve Gerhardt's scruples. The Elector,
on the very same day, returned their statement to the magistrates,
with these words written on the margin:&mdash;&ldquo;If
the preacher, Paul Gerhardt, will not resume the
office so graciously vouchsafed to him again, by his
Serene Electoral Highness, for which he will have to
answer to the Most High God, let the magistrates of
Berlin, at their earliest convenience, invite some other
able and peace-loving persons to preach as candidates;
but let them not call any one until they have first
humbly made known his qualifications to his Serene
Highness.&mdash;C&ouml;hl-on-the-Spree, Feb. 4th, 1667.&mdash;(Signed)
<span class="sc">Friederich Wilhelm</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gerhardt resigned his office, and so ended his
ministry in Berlin. So great was the love his former
flock bore to him that they still continued to contribute
to his support.</p>
<p>It is commonly believed, that after his deposition in
Berlin, he was invited to Saxe-Merseberg by Duke
Christian, and that, on refusing the offer, the Duke
granted him a pension. Otto Schultze, one of his
biographers, and seemingly the most careful and
thorough of them, says that he was unable to find any
certain testimony to either of these facts. It seems
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxix">[xxix]</span>
strange that he should refuse to go to Saxe-Merseberg,
when, a short time after, he unhesitatingly accepted an
invitation from the magistrates of L&uuml;bben, which was
in the territories of Duke Christian; and in his correspondence
with the magistrates of L&uuml;bben there is
no reference to such an invitation from the Duke.
The fact of his refusal, in the first instance, and his
ready acceptance in the second, might be accounted
for, however, by the death of his wife, which took place
in March, 1668, whereby one very strong tie that
bound him to Berlin was severed.</p>
<p>A story is told about this period of his life, and was
for a long time received as an undoubted fact, which is
so romantic that we could almost wish it were true.
It is said, that having no certain dwelling-place, he set
out with his wife and family to return to his fatherland,
Electoral Saxony; that one evening his wife was
sitting in the hotel where they were staying for the
night, bemoaning her hard lot. Gerhardt in vain endeavoured
to console her, and quoted Psalm xxxvii. 5,
to her. Touched by the words himself, he went and sat
down on a garden seat and wrote the song,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<a href="#h46">Commit whatever grieves thee</a>,&rdquo; &amp;c.,</p>
</div>
<p>and came and read it to his wife, who was immediately
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxx">[xxx]</span>
comforted. Later in the evening the Duke of
Saxe-Merseberg's messengers arrived, bearing a letter
to Gerhardt, offering him a pension, till he was otherwise
provided for. They were glad when they found
out who Gerhardt was, and handed him the letter,
which he in turn handed to his wife, saying, &ldquo;Did I
not tell you to commit your ways unto the Lord?&rdquo;
Unfortunately for this story, the hymn in question
had been published in 1666, and the story is otherwise
inconsistent with the known facts of his history.<sup><a id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></sup>
The story is equally groundless, that this hymn was
the means of procuring him an invitation from the
Elector to return to Berlin.</p>
<p>The magistrates of L&uuml;bben, hearing of him, invited
him to preach there, as a candidate for the vacant
archdiaconate. He went thither and preached before
them on October 14th, 1668. The next day he was
informed as to the income, inspected the official residence,
expressed his willingness to accept the appointment,
and was assured that it would be offered to him.
He then returned to Berlin. He did not take up his
residence in L&uuml;bben until June in the following year,
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxxi">[xxxi]</span>
owing partly to domestic affliction, and partly to the
vexatious delay in preparing his official house for his
reception, arising from the dilatoriness and indifference
of the magistrates in the matter. He had expressed
hope, when he saw the house, which was unfit for any
minister to live in, and not large enough for his family,
that a more convenient one might be provided. He
was assured that a deacon's house adjoining wonld be
added to it. A friend visited L&uuml;bben some time after
his appointment, and the work was not begun, nor even
at a later period, when he himself went over. No
sympathy was manifested towards him. He was asked
if he wished to recede from his promise, and whether
he wished a house <i>pro dignitate</i>; and was told that they
did not know he had so large a household, and that
what had been good enough before might be good
enough still. All this must have been exceedingly
annoying and humiliating to Gerhardt. Other points
were raised with reference to the details of his ministerial
duties; but leaving them for friendly settlement
after his entrance on his office, he simply claimed that
a house, not <i>pro dignitate</i>, but <i>pro necessitate</i>, should
be prepared. A full statement of the case, addressed
by him to the Government President, Alex. von Hoymb,
at length produced the desired effect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_xxxii">[xxxii]</div>
<p>He took the oath of religion before the Consistory on
the 6th of June, and entered on the duties of his office
on the third Sunday in Trinity. Gerhardt, in these
transactions, appears to great advantage, in the reasonableness
of his demands, and the manner he dealt with
the ungenerous imputations made upon his motives
and character. He would have removed to L&uuml;bben
sooner had there been a suitable house to be got; but
there was none. He laid stress, in his correspondence,
on the want of a study in the Archdeacon's house, and
insisted on the necessity of having a place for meditation
and prayer, if he was to discharge his duties aright.</p>
<p>There are no written records concerning his work in
L&uuml;bben. Dim tradition says, that he was often melancholy,
that in these moods he would betake himself to
the church, and kneeling before the crucifix, seek
strength in fervent prayer. Feustking (who was almost
his contemporary), General Superintendent in Anhalt-Zerbst,
says, in the preface to his edition of his songs,&mdash;&ldquo;Along
with his piety Gerhardt had the devil, the
false world, and the enemies of religion continually on
his neck, with which he had to contend on the right
and on the left, day and night. He also prayed very
diligently, as earnestly as one pleads with his father.
At the close of his life he had pious Arndt's &lsquo;Prayer
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</span>
and Paradise Garden' continually before him, and so
highly did he esteem it, that he wrote several hymns
on its contents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of Gerhardt's songs appeared in the first
instance in various hymn-hooks. The first complete
edition was published by J. E. Ebeling,
Director of Music in the chief church in Berlin,
in ten folio parts, each containing twelve songs, in
1666-67. It seems that Gerhardt never derived
any pecuniary advantage from their publication.
Tradition says, that after a warm conflict with
the enemy he wrote the hymn
&ldquo;<a href="#h58">Wach auf mein Herz und Singe</a>,&rdquo;
in proof of which the second
verse is quoted. But he wrote no song after
leaving Berlin. Schultze mentions that there is no
song bearing his name that had not been printed
in 1667.</p>
<p>His will, and the rules of life, written before his
death, for his son Paul Friedrich, are worthy of
quotation, revealing as they do the piety, simplicity,
purity, integrity, and also the narrowness of his
character.<sup><a id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></sup>
After expressing his gratitude to God
for all the goodness and truth shown him from his
mother's womb till that hour (he had then reached
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</span>
his seventieth year), his hope of speedy deliverance
from this life and entrance into a better, and
praying God when his time came to take his soul
into His Fatherly hands and grant his body quiet
rest till the last day, when he should be reunited
with those gone before as well as those left
behind, and behold Jesus face to face, in whom he
had believed though he had not seen Him, he goes
on to say:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my only son I leave few earthly possessions,
but an honourable name, of which he will have no
special reason to be ashamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son knows, that from tender infancy I gave
him to the Lord my God as His own, that he
should be a servant and preacher of His Holy Word.
Let it be so, and let him not turn aside because he
may have few good days therein, for God knows
how to compensate for outward trial by inward gladness
of heart and joy in the Holy Ghost. Study
sacred theology in pure schools and incorrupt universities,
and beware of Syncretists, for they seek the
things of time, and are faithful neither to God nor
man. In thine ordinary life, follow not bad company,
but the will and commandment of thy God. In
particular</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_xxxv">[xxxv]</div>
<p>&ldquo;1. Do nothing evil in the hope that it will remain
secret,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;For nothing can so small be spun</p>
<p class="t0">That it comes not to the sun.'</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;2. Never grow angry out of thine office and calling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou findest that anger hath inflamed thee, be
perfectly silent, and do not utter a word until thou
hast first repeated to thyself the Ten Commandments
and the Christian Creed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3. Be ashamed of sinful, fleshly lusts; and when
thou comest to years that thou canst marry, do so
seeking direction from God, and the good counsel of
pious, faithful, and judicious persons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4. Do people good whether they can requite you
or not, for what men cannot requite the Creator of
Heaven and earth has long ago requited, in that He
created thee, hath given thee His dear Son, and in
holy baptism hath received and adopted thee as His
son and heir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;5. Flee covetousness like hell. Be content with
what thou hast acquired with honour and a good
conscience, though it may not be too much. Should
God grant thee more, pray Him to preserve thee
from any hurtful misuse of temporal possessions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</div>
<p><i>Summa</i>; pray diligently, study something honourable,
live peacefully, serve honestly, and remain steadfastly
in thy faith and confession. So wilt thou
one day die and leave this world willingly, gladly,
blessedly! Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He died on the 7th of June, 1676, as the L&uuml;bben
church-book testifies, after he had been seven years
in L&uuml;bben and twenty-five in the ministry.</p>
<p>It is said, that he died with the words of one of his
own hymns on his lips. &ldquo;Death can never kill us
even,&rdquo; from verse 8th of the Christian Song of Joy.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<a href="#h44">Why should sorrow ever grieve me?</a>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He is buried in the chief church, probably near the
altar, though the precise spot cannot be determined.
A portrait in oil, hung up in the church, testifies to
the estimation in which he was held by the congregation,
for besides his, there are only the portraits of
a few General Superintendents, and none of any of his
predecessors in office.</p>
<p>Towards the side, at the foot of the picture are the
words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theologus in cribro Satanae versatus.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</div>
<p>And under that again, the following epigram written
by J. Wernsdorf:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sculpta quidem Pauli, viva est atque imago Gerhardti,</p>

</div>
<p>It is not known what became of his son, and nothing
is known of his posterity.</p>
<p>The editor of the Selection of Gerhardt's Songs&mdash;Bremen,
1817&mdash;states in his preface: &ldquo;There is at
present living in Bremen a great-granddaughter of
Gerhardt's, eighty-one years of age, a simple Christian
soul. Her father was, as she says, an advocate in
Oldenburg; of her ancestor the poet she has neither
written nor oral information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are three of Gerhardt's sermons extant in the
library of the gymnasium of the Grey Cloister in
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</span>
Berlin; and the titles and texts of three more are
known. They are all funeral sermons. We would
close this notice of the life of Gerhardt with a few
extracts from Wackernagel's preface to his edition of
Gerhardt's Spiritual Songs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul Gerhardt,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;may be viewed in a
one-sided manner, from two quite opposite points of
view, in relation to the spiritual contents of his songs.
His poems appear to mirror the transition character of
his age, when the personal life of the feelings, the
subjective tendency, began to assert itself beside the
Christian consciousness of the congregation. He may
therefore be regarded as the last and the most perfect
of those poets who were grounded in the ecclesiastico-confessional
faith, and with him the line of the strict
ecclesiastical poets closes. He may also be regarded
as beginning the line of those in whose songs, praise
and adoration of the revealed God recede before the
expression of the feelings that master the soul in contemplating
its relation to God revealing Himself to it
as its salvation. The true view is, that Gerhardt
stood in the fore front of his age and united in
himself in the most lively manner both tendencies.
Though he did not write so expressly for the congregation,
so immediately in the interest of the church,
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxxix">[xxxix]</span>
as Luther, but from personal necessity, in personal
temptations, yet the pulsation of his inner life was
the common ecclesiastical confession; and his experiences,
however personal they might be, were only
waves of the flood of baptism and life which every
other member of the church breathed and shared.
His sorrow, and God's love, the soul's questions, and
God's answers in him and in his songs, become one&mdash;so
one as can only be when the experience is not
only true for the individual, but also for the people
and the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this reason Paul Gerhardt's are people's songs.
They remind us sometimes of Friedrich Spee; above
all, the glorious song,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;<a href="#h62">Go forth, my heart, and seek delight.</a>'</p>
</div>
<p>But how much richer and more many-sided is the
Evangelical than the Catholic poet, and at the same
time better known and more familiar to the people!
The Catholic congregations know nothing now of
Friedrich Spee; but where is the Evangelical congregation
that does not know Paul Gerhardt; in
what churches are not his holy songs heard? What
the pious Catherine Zell of Strasburg says of beautiful
spiritual songs in her hymn-book is true of him:&mdash;&lsquo;The
<span class="pb" id="pg_xl">[xl]</span>
journeyman mechanic at his work, the servant-maid
washing her dishes, the ploughman and vine-dresser
in the fields, the mother by her weeping
infant in the cradle, sing them.' High and low, poor
and rich alike, find them equally consoling, equally
edifying; in all stations, among young and old,
there are examples to be found where some song
of Gerhardt at particular periods in the history of
the inner life was engraven for ever on the soul,
and subsequently became the centre point of the
dearest reminiscences. Winckleman's favourite song,
even in Italy, after he had passed over to the Catholic
Church, was,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;<a href="#h53">I sing to thee with heart and mouth.</a>'</p>
</div>
<p>And once when he ordered a song-book from Germany,
he was vexed, yea, exasperated, when he found that it
did not contain this song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schiller's mother nurtured the young mind of
her son with the songs of our poet, with whom
the song</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;<a href="#h61">Now spread are evening shadows</a>'</p>
</div>
<p>was a favourite,&mdash;the same song concerning which
Johann Falk narrates that a beggar boy was preserved
<span class="pb" id="pg_xli">[xli]</span>
amid many temptations by singing to himself the
stanza commencing</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;<a href="#h61">O Jesus! be my cover.</a>'</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Books devoted to the exposition of spiritual songs,
or to facts concerning pious persons, relate how many
of Gerhardt's hymns have quickened many hearts in
heavy affliction and anxiety, and have quietly composed

to peace....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above all, it was the mothers who fostered the
domestic spiritual song, and handed down the old
songs to the new generation. The noble picture of
such a mother, even of his own, is sketched by T. F.
Hippel, and the words in which she described the
peculiarity of the poet to her son serve to portray
herself as well as Gerhardt:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;After Luther, I must confess, I know no better
hymn-poet than Gerhardt. He, Rist, and Dach form
a trefoil, but the chosen instrument, Luther, was the
root. Gerhardt wrote during the ringing of the church
bells, so to speak. A certain impressiveness, a certain
sorrowfulness, a certain fervour, were peculiar to him;
he was a guest on earth, and everywhere in his one
hundred and twenty-three songs sunflowers are sown.
<span class="pb" id="pg_xlii">[xlii]</span>
This flower ever turns to the sun, so does Gerhardt
to a blessed eternity.'</p>
<p>&ldquo;The love with which the contemporaries of Gerhardt,
as far as the bell of an evangelical church was
heard, turned to his song, has only one precedent&mdash;the
veneration, the devotion, with which Luther's songs
were regarded. The songs of no other poet, either
before or since, have ever produced so mighty an effect
or obtained so speedy and so wide a circulation.&rdquo;</p>
